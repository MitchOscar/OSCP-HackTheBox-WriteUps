# OSCP-HackTheBox-WriteUps
This is my collection of writeups/notes for HackTheBox machines that I'm using to prepare for the OSCP certification exam.

I tried to use my own methodology for each one of these boxes so any reader can understand my methodology while going through rooting the machines.
The first page of each writeups/notes includes a page of new things/tools I learned while doing the machine, so if you are following along while doing the machines, skip the first
page if you don't want it to get spoiled.

Otherwise if you are looking to take the same type of notes while studying I highly recommend it because you will definetly need it for the OSCP exam if you are looking to take it.

I used CherryTree to take these notes in combination with Flameshot to take screenshots. I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommened using these two tools, they are really great for note-taking.
